# Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator application made using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). AWT is an API for creating graphical user interface (GUI) or window-based applications in Java. It provides various components like buttons, labels, text fields, etc. that can be used as objects inside a Java program.

The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It has a user-friendly interface that consists of a text field for entering and displaying the numbers, and buttons for choosing the operators and clearing the input.

To run the project, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can compile and execute the source code using any Java IDE or command line tool.
